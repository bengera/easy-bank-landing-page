## Overview
This is the first site I have made using the @use and @forward rules using instead of @import.
The most challenging aspect of creating this site was trying to get the mobile image and background pattern
scaling smoothly while staying relatively close to the top nav bar. The final result looks fine for mobile and
desktop, the site could definately use some changes for the tablet but the design files for this were not included. 
The changes made for the tablet screen were minimal so it is best to view the site on a desktop or mobile screen.


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
